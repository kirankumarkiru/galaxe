create a branch in the main folder

cloning
1. create a folder in the desktop 
right click get git bash here 
$ git clone -b branchname pasteurl
enter the new folder

whatever changes you make in the web to be reflected in the local we use 
$ git push

whatever changes made by others in the web to be reflected in the local we use 
$ git fetch

inorder to obtain the status we do 
$ git status

inorder to create a branch in the local and upload it in the web we do
$ git branch "branch name"

or directly do create branch in the command prompt
and then do add, commit and push.

we can do all the three commands together at a single time.
